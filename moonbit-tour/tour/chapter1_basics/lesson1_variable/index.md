# Variables

The `let` keyword is used to define a variable.

The type of the variable can be annotated by using a colon followed by the type.
It is optional; if not provided, the type will be inferred from the value.

Variables are immutable by default in MoonBit. You can add an extra `mut`
keyword to make them mutable at the local level.

If you uncomment the `d = d + 1`, you will get an error.
